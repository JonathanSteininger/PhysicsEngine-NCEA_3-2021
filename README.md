# PhysicsEngine-NCEA_3-2021
This is the repository relating to the physics engine I am making In JavaScript.

This project contains a javascript canves game where the player being a black in 2D space will need to reach the endeing in a certain amount of time.

This game has a menu, constructors for creating game objects, built in physics which are a bit dodgy, and a replay system.
The game saves past plays and is able to replay them, It saves high scores and replays in the websites cache.
the game has multiple difficulties allowing for the player to challenge themselves. 

The map is hand drawn, all the collision lines were imported with another program I made, where it takes the position of the cursor and imports it into the game location.

the game is fully scalable with a dynamic resolution.
